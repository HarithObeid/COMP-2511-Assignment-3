        <p>
            <!-- About my java projects -->
            In my Object Oriented programming class I have created multiple different programs using the Java programming language. 
            As these projects are still begginer level programs they aren't too complicated or impressive.
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- Diffrent Projects -->
            Some of the different programs I have created are:
            <ul>
                <li>A blackjack game where the user plays against the computer</li>
                <li>A file reader program where the program reads a file that acts like a database file for a toystore and the user can do multiple different actions
                    to the file such as:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Search for different prodcuts in the file</li>
                        <li>Purchase products</li>
                        <li>Add stock to a product</li>
                        <li>Add a new product</li>
                        <li>Remove a product</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            <!-- Description of my python projects -->
            Like my java projects my python projects where all very begginer level programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the different python programs I have created are:
            <ul>
                <li>A file reader that reads a file compars the file it just read to the condtions a person needs to be able to immigrate to Canada.</li>
                <li>A program that acts like this specific website that changes and creates different outputs based on the different inputs the user inserts.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <!-- HTML Projects-->
        <h2 id="htmlProjects">HTML Projects</h2>
        <p>
            <!--Description of my HTML Projects-->
            I have created a couple of different websites using HTML and CSS together. Some of the websites I have created were made with the help
            of others as they were group projects. I have expereice with coding HTML and CSS on my own though and would be able to create a fully functioning website easily.
        </p>
